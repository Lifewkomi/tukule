# TUKULE- A 3D Restaurant Application where users can order meals and reserve seats in 3D.

Tukule is a dynamic, user-friendly eatery and restaurant web application that allows users to explore menus, order meals, and manage restaurant reservations online. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this app aims to deliver a smooth and visually appealing user experience, leveraging modern technologies like GSAP and Framer Motion to bring animations and transitions to life.

# FEATURES
This is a product that is under development. It was created to be a middleware between restaurant clients and customers and the restaurant management that offers food and accomodation services.

The experience of reserving seats in restaurants is and often may be boring and does not allow for correct preview of the experience before purchase or reservations.

Here I try to demonstrate how you can make this experience half immersive using Spline and Three.js
